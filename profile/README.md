# MAESTRO: Opacities for Planets, Exoplanets, and Brown Dwarfs 

## About

To interpret next generation exoplanet observations successfully and robustly, the community needs access to validated & up-to-date opacities. This was the motivation for the MAESTRO (Molecules and Atoms in (Exo)Planet Science: Tools and Resources for Opacities) database, a NASA-supported opacity service that can be accessed by the community via a web interface. The MAESTRO project  aims to develop community standards in computing and publishing opacity data. This is because subtle choices in opacities lead to model inconsistencies in the analysis of both high-resolution (R>10,000) and low resolution (JWST-like) observations. MAESTRO (Molecules and Atoms in (Exo)Planet Spectroscopy: Tools and Resources for Opcaities) is designed to help you find the data you need, as well as understand how the data was created.
